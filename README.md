Scheme interpreter in Haskell
======

Time to use Haskell for a nontrivial task. As I don't know any Scheme beyond
the Wikipedia introduction, I'm using [Write Yourself a Scheme][schemetut] as
a reference for how the language works. Apart from that, the initial development
is planned to be as independent of the tutorial as possible; after I'm happy
with a module, I'll be looking up what I've missed.
