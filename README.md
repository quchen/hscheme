Scheme interpreter in Haskell
======

Time to use Haskell for a nontrivial task. As I don't know any Scheme beyond
a brief read of some online tutorial and having [Land of Lisp][LandOfLisp] on my
computer, I'm using [Write Yourself a Scheme][schemetut] as a reference for how
the language works. Apart from that, the initial development is planned to be as
independent of the tutorial as possible; after I'm happy with a module, I'll be
looking up what I've missed.
